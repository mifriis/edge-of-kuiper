# Edge of Kuiper

This game puts you into the captains chair of your very own spaceship in the Sol system. Your purpose is to make money and retire.

* Trade
* Invest
* Take missions
* Combat
* Interact with random events
* Hire crew
* Outfit your ship

It's an async realtime game experience where time since your last visit is accelerated and happenings are generated.

The game is entirely based on Console commands, text and perhaps some nice ASCII graphics. The core of the game should be adaptable to discord bots or web. 

## Build and run

* Open in VS Code 
* F5
* See the terminal
